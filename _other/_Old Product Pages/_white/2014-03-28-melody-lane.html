description: Expressing the finest attributes of Southern Rhone style blends, this wine demonstrates the perfect notes of an afternoon white. Dry but not harsh, it has a light citrus background and a smooth finish. It pairs well with summer salads and light seafood and works independently as a relaxing and pleasant way to begin an evening. <br /> It is a Southern Rhone style blend of 32% Grenache blanc, 29% Marsanne, 29% Vermentino, and 10% Viognier.
