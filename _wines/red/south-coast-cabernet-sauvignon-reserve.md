**Granite Lion Cellars is pleased to deliver a Reserve, full-bodied wine that emphasizes all the best characteristics of a Cabernet Sauvignon.**

Each year has a unique taste, deep flavor and firm tannins that deliver a complex character and makes the varietal the king of grapes. Our vines are nestled in the foothills of San Diego; cradled against the sun and fed by the evening sea breezes. &nbsp;The grapes are demonstrating the quality fruit produced by our vines that can, in fact, become world class wines. &nbsp;After our grapes are patiently hand-picked from the estate vines, pressed with care, and stored in a French oak barrel for 24 months of aging.

**Serving Fine Wine**<br>decant, approximately 15 minutes before serving

**Recommend Pairings**<br>Red meats/lamb: steaks, ribs, roasts. &nbsp;For those who prefer a vegan dish, we recommend pairing with a hearty pasta.
