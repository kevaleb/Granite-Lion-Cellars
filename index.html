	<h2 class="editable">At Granite Lion Cellars, we believe in the goodness of life.</h2>
	<p class="editable">Abundant, beautiful, and joyful, the vineyard expresses an idea that the best things in life are simple and honest. If there is truth in wine, it comes from the plain transition of fruit and soil and sun into a blend of art and fate.</p>
	<p class="editable">Granite Lion Cellars begins with the best vine stock and cherishes the distinctive characteristics that make every variety unique because we understand that all we take through life is ourselves. A young winery, Granite Lion Vineyards presents a rich and distinctive taste intrinsic to the passion of youth.</p>
	<p class="editable">And, young at heart, we believe doing everything with all our soul is the best way to reflect the beauty of life.</p>

		The holidays are over, the twinkly lights are down, the time has turned to a new year. 
		<br /><br />
		In the vineyard, season to season is marked through the life of wine. 
		<br /><br />
		Please join us for a celebration on January 29th at the vineyard from 2:00 PM to dusk. The bottling truck will be onsite for our new vintages. We are pleased to offer tastings of our brand new 2015 whites and 2013 reds in the Grove with a light barbecue sponsored by the owner.

	<p class="quote">The wine is in the bottle, the grapes are slowly waking to the new light, and it is time to make merry!</p>
	
	<p>See you there!</p>
