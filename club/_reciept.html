	<p>We'll ship your wine out as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>But... There are times during the hottest parts of the year where, if we ship you your wine it will be damaged due to the heat. During those times we will NOT ship your wine. Instead, we will hold off and wait for warmer weather.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
