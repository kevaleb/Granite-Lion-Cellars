<p><strong>Granite Lion Cellars is pleased to deliver a Reserve, full-bodied wine that emphasizes all the best characteristics of a Cabernet Sauvignon.</strong></p>

<p>Each year has a unique taste, deep flavor and firm tannins that deliver a complex character and makes the varietal the king of grapes. Our vines are nestled in the foothills of San Diego; cradled against the sun and fed by the evening sea breezes.  The grapes are demonstrating the quality fruit produced by our vines that can, in fact, become world class wines.  After our grapes are patiently hand-picked from the estate vines, pressed with care, and stored in a French oak barrel for 24 months of aging.</p>
